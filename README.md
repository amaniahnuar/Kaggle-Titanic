# Kaggle Titanic Project  

This is my solution to the Kaggle competition **"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"**, implemented in an IPython Notebook. The project demonstrates a practical approach to analyzing data, building predictive models, and submitting results to Kaggle. It's perfect for beginners exploring data science or Python-based machine learning competitions.

## Installation  

Follow these steps to run this notebook interactively:  

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Install [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).  
3. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   virtualenv env  
   ```  
4. Activate the virtual environment:  
   - **Linux/Mac:**  
     ```bash  
     source env/bin/activate  
     ```  
   - **Windows:**  
     ```bash  
     env\Scripts\activate  
     ```  
5. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
6. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:  
   ```bash  
   ipython notebook  
   ```  
7. Open `Titanic.ipynb` from the notebook dashboard to explore the analysis.  
8. When done, deactivate the virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   deactivate  
   ```

## About the Kaggle Competition  

The **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition challenges participants to predict which passengers survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic. This competition serves as an introduction to machine learning and provides a chance to work on a real dataset.  

**Background:**  
- The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg, claiming 1,502 lives out of 2,224 passengers and crew.  
- Survival rates varied significantly based on factors like gender, age, and class.  

**Goal:**  
Use machine learning to predict which passengers survived the disaster.
